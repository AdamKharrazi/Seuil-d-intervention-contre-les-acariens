Decision: Inspect one additional tree (up to a maximum of 20 trees).

Percentage of infested leaves > 53%
Decision: Immediate treatment.

Case 2: Absence of Predators
Percentage of infested leaves < 15%
Decision: Postpone treatment.

Percentage of infested leaves between 15% and 32%
Decision: Inspect one additional tree (up to a maximum of 20 trees).
